{"name":"Monero Examples","tagline":"tutanota-compile-ubuntu","body":"# Compile Tutanota client on Ubuntu 14.14\r\nThe example shows how to compile the open sourced Tutanota\r\nclient so that you can host it yourself. Once you compile it,\r\nyou can host the client yourself, on your localhost for example. This has many benefits. First, the client loads faster as it only fetches files\r\nfrom your localhost. Second, its safer. You host it yourself, so there is no reason to worry that suddenly the client code suddenly changes and adds some back-doors or something.  Third, you can modify it to your liking.  \r\n\r\nThe following instructions are based on those available at [tutao/tutanota](https://github.com/tutao/tutanota/#building-and-running-your-own-tutanota-web-client).\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# first we need to install package manager for nodejs called nmp\r\n# this will also pull all its dependencies\r\nsudo apt-get install npm\r\n\r\n# get latest tutanota source code from github\r\ngit clone https://github.com/tutao/tutanota.git\r\n\r\ncd tutanota/web\r\n\r\n# download dependencies\r\nnpm install\r\n\r\n# install gulp build system localy\r\nnpm install --save-dev gulp\r\n\r\n# need to make the following sympolic link\r\n# without it, gupl returns an error:\r\n# /usr/bin/env: node: No such file or directory\r\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/local/bin/node\r\n\r\n# build the tutanota client\r\n../node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js dist\r\n\r\n# check if the works example\r\nfirefox build/index.html\r\n\r\n#Now you can copy the build folder to whereever you want it to be.\r\n#For example, I have it /opt\r\nsudo mv build/ /top/tuta\r\n\r\n# now you can run the tutanota client as follows\r\nfirefox /opt/tuta/index.html\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What it has to do with Monero?\r\n\r\nWell, both [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/) and [Monero](https://getmonero.org) take privacy of their users seriously. Also, maybe soon, one will be able to [donate](http://tutanota.uservoice.com/forums/237921-general/suggestions/9968298-accept-monero-xmr-for-donations) to Tutanota using Monero.\r\n\r\n## How can you help?\r\n\r\nConstructive criticism, corrections of the website are always welcome.  \r\nThey can be made through github.\r\n\r\nSome Monero are also welcome:\r\n```\r\n48daf1rG3hE1Txapcsxh6WXNe9MLNKtu7W7tKTivtSoVLHErYzvdcpea2nSTgGkz66RFP4GKVAsTV14v6G3oddBTHfxP6tU\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
